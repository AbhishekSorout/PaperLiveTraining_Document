	Fundamentals of Linux ::::
	
		Introduction to Linux!
		
			Operating System!:
			
				-> It is an interface between the user Applications and Underlying Hardware.
				
					Eg.: Windows/Mac/Linux 
			
	Linux Operating System 
	
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process

	Package Management - Package Managers :::
	
		- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
	
			- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
			- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
			- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
											yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
											
		- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
		
			- TO work with Package Manager :
				- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
					- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level

	- User Management & Access Management :::
		
		
		Create Linux User :

		SSH Connection :	Secure SHell Connection 
		
			-> Host Name 
			-> User Name 
			-> User Authentication 


			-> Authentication Types :
			
				- Password Based Authentication
				
				- Key Based Authentication			# Recommended for any Remote Server Communication
					- Public Key 
					- Private Key 
					- authorized keys
					
				- Token Based Authentication
				
				- Passwordless Authentication




		How to Create Linux User ?
		
			Username : devopsadmin 
			
			Bash Terminal Access :
			
			Home Dir :
			
			password :
			
			ssh-keys :



		Create Linux User with SSH Keys :::
		
			sudo -i 
			
			useradd devopsadmin2 -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin2

			su - devopsadmin2

			exit 
			
			sudo -i 
			
			# Create Password for Linux User ::::
			
			root@ip-172-31-3-184:~# passwd devopsadmin2
			New password:
			Retype new password:
			passwd: password updated successfully
			root@ip-172-31-3-184:~# exit
			logout
			ubuntu@ip-172-31-3-184:~$ su - devopsadmin2
			Password:
			devopsadmin2@ip-172-31-3-184:~$

			# Create SSH Key for Linux User ::::

			ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521					#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				

			cd .ssh
			
			ls ~/.ssh 

			#You should see following two files:

			#id_ecdsa - private key
			#id_ecdsa.pub - public
			
			
			cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys			# authorized_keys this file name should be same.
			
			authorized_keys :::
				It is the copy of Public Key.
				
				Always the private key will be compared with the authorized_keys
				
			chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin2/.ssh/*					# Used to Change the Access Mode of Files or Directories
			
			
		Get the List of Linux Users ::::
			cat /etc/passwd
		
		Get the list of Linux User Groups :::: 
			cat /etc/group
	
		sudo -i 
		
		apt install docker.io -y 
		
		usermod -aG docker devopsadmin2				# Provide access to Docker Service!

Day 6 : 2nd Sep. 2025
#########################	
	
	
	
	- Remote Servers Management :::	

		VM1 
		
		VM2 
		
		Environments :
		
			Dev Environment (VM1)
			
			Build Environment --> Application Build ==> *.war 
			 
			QA (VM1) *.war 
			
			UAT (VM1) *.war 
			
			Prod (VM1) *.war 

Use Case :

		1. Establish Connection to Remote Server  
		2. Login to the Remote Server 
		3. Copy the Files from one server to another server
			using SCP
		4. Manage the Remote Server - Install any package/Uninstall/Upgrade 
		
		Pre-requisites for Remote Server :::
		
			- Launch 2 VMs (VM1-Source & VM2-Target)
			
			- Ensure that Port 22 is enabled 
			
			- Create User in both the VMs 
			
			- Create SSH-Key in one server(VM1)
					ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
					
			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2)
			
			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
	
	
		-> Authentication : Tells who can access the Server 	
		
		-> Authorization : Tells what can be done on that Server


		Target_Server --> 

			- Create User in both the VMs ::::
			
				useradd adminuser -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/adminuser

				su - adminuser					

			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2) :::

				mkdir .ssh 

				cd .ssh 


				vi authorized_keys

				#paste the id_ecdsa.pub of devopsadmin user from Server machine to authorized_keys file in Client Machine 

				chmod 600 /home/adminuser/.ssh/*


			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)

					ssh adminuser@172.31.35.84 			# Using Private IP Address

					exit 								# To Close Connection
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
			

				#cp  /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt home/devopsadmin/dir1/
		
				 scp /home/devopsadmin2/sourcefile.txt adminuser@172.31.35.84:/home/adminuser
				 
				 
				 Web Application Server in Target Machine :
				 
					Tomcat / Nginx 
				 
				
				Source_Server 										Target_Server using Tomcat
																		
					*.war 													/opt/tomcat/webapps
			
					scp /home/devopsadmin2/*.war		adminuser@172.31.35.84:/opt/tomcat/webapps
					
				
			- Change the Ownership :
			
				chown -R adminuser:adminuser /opt/tomcat/
				
				chown -R adminuser:adminuser /root/dir1
			
			
			- Copy Directories to Target Server ::
			
				 scp -r /home/devopsadmin2/sampledir1 adminuser@172.31.35.84:/home/adminuser


		To Add Any User to a Group :
		
			usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name>
			
			usermod -aG docker devopsadmin2

	
	- Process Automation(Shell Scripting) :::
	
	
		Fundamentals of Shell Scripts on DevOps Perspectives :::
			
		
			Scripting Languages ?
				- Are used to perform some process automation/validations
				- Light-weight 
				- Eg.: java scripts / shell scripts / yaml script / groovy / python 
					(vs)
			Progamming Language ?
				- Are used to create some business applications 
				- Huge Collection of Programming components
				- Eg.: Java/.Net Framework/Python/Ruby/Cobol/C
		
		
	Shell Scripting Language :
	
		- Shell Scripting is a collection shell commands 
		- Shell Script file should be saved as *.sh (Extention should be .sh)
		
	Install git ?
	
		Install all these packages in 200 VMs :::
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y 	
	
	vi Build_Server_Config.sh
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y	
	
	Build Environment Server (VM):	To Perform Application Build - Identify the Source Code,Compile,Create Artifacts(Binaries)
	
		- Install all the required build tools : 1 Build Server ==> 50 Build Server!
		
				- apt install git -y  
				- apt install jdk -y 
				- apt install maven -y 			# Build Tool 
				- apt install docker.io -y 		# To Containerize Application
				
				
			vi javamaven-buildconfig.sh
			
				sudo apt install git -y  
	            sudo apt install jdk -y 
	            sudo apt install maven -y 		
                sudo apt install docker.io -y 	
				
				
			Test Servers :::
			
			
				- testing tools - TestNG / Selenium / jdk / docker
				
				
			Periodic Server Management :::
			
			
				- Clean-up 
				
					rm dir!
					
					
					
			Periodic Backup of Files/Directories


				#!/bin/bash
				sudo apt install git -y 
				sudo apt install openjdk11 -y
				sudo apt install maven -y 
				sudo apt install docker.io -y
				#sudo apt install ansible -y 

				save the script as installbuildtools.sh 

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ls 
				installbuildtools.sh	

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ./installbuildtools.sh		# Run the Shell Script!
