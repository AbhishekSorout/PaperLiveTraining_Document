	Fundamentals of Linux ::::
	
		Introduction to Linux!
		
			Operating System!:
			
				-> It is an interface between the user Applications and Underlying Hardware.
				
					Eg.: Windows/Mac/Linux 
			
	Linux Operating System 
	
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 
			
		- Command Line Interface 
		
		- Linux Distributions :::
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora	
				
		
		
		Lab Requirements!

			-> Github Account ::
					- https://github.com/
					
					- Maintain the Application files and components 
					- Training Documentations
					
			-> Create AWS Cloud Free-tier Account!
					- https://aws.amazon.com/console/
					
					- Use this like to create free tier account :
					
						- Active Email_ID 
						- Active Mobile Number
						- Active Credit/Debit Card - Enable with International Transaction
											
					
					- Create a Virtual Machine! Linux based.
					
					- Connect to Virtual Machine 
					
						SSH Connection - Secure SHell Connection to Linux VM.
						
							- Host Name (VM - External IP Address)
							
							- User Name 
							
							- User Credentials
							
								--> Authentication Types :
								
										- Password Based Authentication 
										
										- Token Based Authentication
										
										- Key Based Authentication						# Default
										
										- Passwordless Authentication
					
					
					
			-> DockerHub Account ::
					- Working with Docker 
				
	
	



	Package Management - Package Managers :::
	
		- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
	
			- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
			- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
			- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
											yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
											
		- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
		
			- TO work with Package Manager :
				- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
					- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		

	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :
	
		What the Role of DevOps Team/Engineer on Linux.
		
			- All the DevOps Tools can be installed and Managed in Linux Machines 
		
		What is your role here ????
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools 
			- Package Management - Periodically Upgrade/Uninstall - Backup of the Tools
			- Managing Remote Servers 
				- Client Server Architecture 
				- Server1 (VM)
					- Client1,2,3,4,5,6
					
			- As a DevOps Team we can Manage the Linux Machines
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)
				

		- Package Management :::

			- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
		
				- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
				- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
												yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
												
			- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
			
				- TO work with Package Manager :
					- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
						- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		
		
		
		
			- To Install any tool/package :
			
				Install Pre-requisites	
				Install Actual Tool
				Post Installation Actions				
		
					Eg.: Tomcat :::: 
					
						Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
						
						Install Actual Tool				===> Installed Tomcat 
						
						Post Installation Actions		===> Started Tomcat 
		
		
		Package :::
		
			-> apt install git 
			
			-> apt install jdk 
			
			-> apt install maven 
			
			-> apt upgrade maven 
			
			-> apt remove maven 
			
			
		Package : Web Application Server Package 
		
			Eg.: 
					Tomcat / Nginx / httpd 
					
					
					
		Types of Packages ::
		
			--> Install any software/package :
			
					-> Installed & Executed as a tool/service.
					
					
					-> apt install jenkins 
					
						--> All Services can be accessible using the external IP Address and its default port number
