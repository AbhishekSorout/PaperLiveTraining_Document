	--> Containerization using Docker ::::	
	
	Introduction :::
	
	
	Containerization ::::
	
		-> It is process of packaging the application along with its dependencies!
		
		
	Virtual Machine :::
	
		- VMs are called as Hardware Level Virtualization
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor
		- VMs are used to execute an Operating System 
		- VMs will continue to run even if there is not active Application/Task
		- VMs consume more Time and space to start any Application/Task	
		

	Container :::
	
		- Containers are called as OS Level Virtualization
		- Containers are created using Container Engine(Docker)
		- Containers are used to execute any Application/Task. Not Operating System 		
		- Containers will immediately go to exit state, if there is No active Application/Task		
		- Containers consume less Time and space to start any Application/Task	

		- Using Containers, we can reduce the no. of VMs. But we cannot completely eliminate VMs.
		
		- Containers use the properties of underlying Operating System
		
			Kernel			==> Is the core of Linux Operating 

				- Namespaces 				
				- Control Groups
